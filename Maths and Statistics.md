## Data & Visualization Basics

### Types of Data
1. **Structured data** is organized, follows a clear format,
and is easy to work with. (Ex: Table data, JSON,
XML)
2. **Unstructured data** lacks a specific structure, is
more diverse in content, and requires specialized  tools and techniques for analysis. (Ex: Audio, Video,
Free Form Text)

3. **Numeric data** consists of numerical values that
represent measurable quantities or continuous variables 

    - **Continuous data** encompasses an infinite range of
    precise values, often with decimals. (Ex. Stock prices over a period of time)

    - **Discrete data**, on the other hand, comprises
    distinct, countable numerical values. (Ex. a film released in 2025)

4. **Categorical data** represents categories, labels, or
distinct groups. It is used to classify and categorize
items or observations based on certain
characteristics or attributes.
    - **Nominal data** consists of categories or labels with
    no inherent order or ranking. (Ex. Product categories)

    - **Ordinal data** unlike nominal data, has a specific
    order or ranking among categories.(Ex. Students grades)

### Pie and Bar Chart

1. Use a **bar chart** when you have benchmark values
to compare with.
2. Use a Horizontal bar chart when **category labels**
are long.
3. Use a Horizontal bar chart instead of a pie chart
when the number of categories is **more than 5**.
4. Use a vertical bar chart for **time series data**.
5. Consider a **Clustered Column** chart for comparing
multiple data series within distinct categories.

### Histogram and Line Chart

1. Histograms are primarily used to show the
**frequency distribution** of a continuous or discrete
dataset.
2. In a histogram, all bins are of **equal size**.
3. A line chart is useful in presenting the **trend or
change** in data over a period.
4. A stacked column chart used to represent and
compare multiple categories in a single bar, while
also displaying the overall total.

### Scatter and Bubble Plot

 1. A **scatter plot** is a graph that uses a grid to present
data values, typically involving two variables within
a dataset.

 2. Scatter plots help to visualize the **relationship
between two variables**.

3. A **Bubble chart** is a variation of a Scatter Plot that
allows you to represent a third variable through the
size of the bubbles.

4. **Scatter plots** and Bubble Charts help to detect
outliers, visualize the relationship between two
variables, and also Identify trends.

### Univariate vs Bivariate vs Multivariate analysis

1. **Univariate analysis** = Analysis of a **single** variable
2. **Bivariate analysis** = Analysis of **two** variables
3. **Multivariate analysis** = Analysis of > **two** variables
